Shall we declare this experiment a failure yet, or charge onward?
Let's give it one more time.

Today I'll:
  * Figure out why we've gotten now UX help on BrowserID.  wtf?
  * Set up auto updating for dev & beta on commit.

This week I'll:
  * Help out brett gaylor with the popcorn.js configurator
  * Teach someone else how to deploy.
  * Set up mysql on beta, and migrate databases producing a migration script.
  * Lay down a scaling strategy (with short writeup?) for review by zandr and that other dude.  who was that other dude?
