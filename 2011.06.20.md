Wow, surprisingly, I somehow accomplished most of last week's dotPlan!

This week:

* **chromeless** complete unit testing framework and scope 0.4 (revisted from last week)
* Get BrowserID "announcement ready".  Which means [finish this](https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues?milestone=5&state=open)
* Finish the user pitch (60s sceencast?): https://browserid.org/users.html
* short blog about browserid w/thunder?  Or capture some more interesting/technical elements of it in a self-posted entry...  think think.
