today:

  * (!) **chromeless** Review and merge [david murdoch's patch](https://github.com/davidmurdoch/chromeless/commit/449c8ec49bc0cc6ec9ee1c767154d01bda4ede6d)
    that improves the frame-busting situation, but does not cure cancer.
  * (!) Make sure Atul knows how interesting I think integration of jsonselect into blobastorus is.
  * (!) Send anup my thoughts on the moz dev challenge platform.
  * **chromeless** initial sketch of the "chromeless, getting to 1.0" document

It is worth noting that I was distracted at least 4 times in generating these 600 or so characters.
