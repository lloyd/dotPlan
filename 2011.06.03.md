today:

  * **chromeless** Review and merge [david murdoch's patch](https://github.com/davidmurdoch/chromeless/commit/449c8ec49bc0cc6ec9ee1c767154d01bda4ede6d)
    that improves the frame-busting situation, but does not cure cancer.
  * Make sure Atul knows how interesting I think integration of jsonselect into blobastorus is.
  * Send ante my thoughts on the moz dev challenge platform.

It is worth noting that I was distracted at least 4 times in generating these 485 characters.
