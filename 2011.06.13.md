Hmm.  Last week after talking to @benadida and realizing that others
felt an explicit grassrootsification of the BrowserID project is a
Good Thing.  This is awesome as I feel like with a teeny tiny
investment we can really move this forward and give people a visceral
idea of what better federated authentication looks like on the web.
And it's starting the discusion with action, me like.

So that makes my weekly goals look like this:

* **chromeless** air out proposed 1.0 plan.
* **chromeless** complete unit testing framework and release 0.4
* **browserid** [milestone 1](https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues?milestone=1&state=open)
* **browserid** [milestone 2](https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues?milestone=2&state=open)
